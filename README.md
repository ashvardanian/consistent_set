# If only [`std::set`][set] was a [DBMS][dbms]

This library provides you with a few containers:

* `consistent_set`: serializable consistency, fully sorted, based on [`std::set`][set].
* `consistent_avl`: serializable consistency, fully sorted, based on [AVL trees][avl].
* `versioning_avl`: snapshot isolation via [MVCC][mvcc], fully sorted, based on [AVL trees][avl].

All containers:

* are [`noexcept`] top to bottom!
* are templated, to be used with any `noexcept`-movable and `default`-constructible types.
* can be wrapped into `locked_gt`, to make them thread-safe.
* can be wrapped into `partitioned_gt`, to make them concurrent.

...if you are feeling crazy and want your exceptions and all the classical interfaces back, you can also wrap any container into `crazy_gt`.

## Installation & Usage

The entire library is header-only.
You can just copy-paste it, but its not 2021 any more.
To use this with any packaging/build tool you only need C++17 support.

### CMake

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    consistent_set
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ashvardanian/consistent_set
    GIT_TAG main
    CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
    BUILD_COMMAND ""
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(consistent_set)
include_directories(${consistent_set_SOURCE_DIR})
```

### Conan

In your `conanfile.txt`, just add:

```toml
[requires]
consistent_set
```

## Testing & Performance

All the stress-testing is done via [UKV][ukv].
That library is stuffed with unit-, integration-, consistency- and stress-tests.

Performance-wise, concurrent versions are generally bottlenecked by "mutexes" you are using.
So we allow different implementations:

* STLs: [`std::shared_mutex`][shared_mutex]
* Intels One API: [`tbb::rw_mutex`][tbb] or others

## Why I created this?

Hate for [`std::bad_alloc`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/bad_alloc).
If you consider "Out of Memory" to be an exception, you are always underutilizing your system.
It happened way too many times that a program just crashed when I was only getting to the interesting place.
Especially with:

* [Neo4J][neo4j] and every other JVM-based project.
* With big batch sizes beyond VRAM sizes of GPU when doing ML.

At Unum we live in the conditions where machines can easily have 1 TB of RAM per CPU socket, but it is still at least 100x smaller than the datasets we are trying to swallow.

Furthermore, I have been working on [UKV][ukv] for a while now, as we want to standardize CRUD interfaces across databases.
An we needed features, that are missing from Standard Templates Library containers:

> Accessing the **allocator state** by reference.
> **Reserving** memory for tree nodes before inserting.
> Explicitly traversing trees for **random sampling**.
> **Speed**!
